# Weather-App

This is a simple weather app, taking location and displaying current weather in this location. What I am going to use here is plain HTML, JavaScript and CSS with Sass. This project is made for The Odin Project's course purpoes.
Here is a dircet link to [the project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/weather-app).
